# LeetCode Python Solutions

Welcome to the **LeetCode Python Solutions** repository! This repository contains Python solutions for various LeetCode problems, demonstrating different algorithms and data structures. Each solution is encapsulated within a class method, offering a clear and efficient approach to solving these common coding challenges.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following Python files, each containing a solution to a specific problem:

1. **Two Sum** - Find indices of two numbers that add up to a target.
2. **Reverse Integer** - Reverse the digits of an integer.
3. **Palindrome Number** - Check if an integer is a palindrome.
4. **Integer to Roman** - Convert an integer to a Roman numeral.
5. **Roman to Integer** - Convert a Roman numeral to an integer.
6. **Longest Common Prefix** - Find the longest common prefix string among an array of strings.
7. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** - Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
8. **3Sum** - Find all unique triplets in the array that sum up to zero.
9. **3Sum Closest** - Find the sum of three integers closest to the target.
10. **Letter Combinations of a Phone Number** - Return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.
11. **4Sum** - Find all unique quadruplets in the array that sum up to the target.
12. **Valid Parentheses** - Determine if the input string of brackets is valid.
13. **Generate Parentheses** - Generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

All files are located in the `LeetCode` directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GururajaSR/LeetCode-Python-Solutions.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd LeetCode-Python-Solutions
   ```

3. **Run a Solution**:
   Navigate to the specific file you want to execute. For example:
   ```bash
   python LeetCode/leet.py
   ```

## Usage

Each Python file includes a class `Solution` with methods to solve a particular problem. The test cases provided in each file demonstrate how to use the methods and validate their correctness.

To run a solution, execute the corresponding Python file. For example, to test the "Two Sum" solution, you would run:
```bash
python LeetCode/two_sum.py
```
